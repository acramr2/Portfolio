			<h3>My Experience</h3>
				<p>You can find my educational experience on my <a href="growing.html">Growing Up with Art page!</a></p>
				<p>My career experience revolving around digital design began in my high school education where companies would ask my teacher to create logos, t-shirts, and business cards for them. My teacher assigned the class to make their designs and the company would choose their favorite design. Even though I was not selected, I still gained experience on working with a client. I was personally selected to design a t-shirt for a track team. I found favor of my design by the track coach.</p>
				<p> As of current experience development, I am in college majoring in computer science. I've taken a web design class to bring my art together on this website.</p>
