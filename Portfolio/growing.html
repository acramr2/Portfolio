				<dd>Before 4th grade in elementary school, everything I attempted to draw would end up looking like scribbles. My teachers would even call me out for the lack of effort when I really just had a lack of control with my wrist to create drawings. My uncle, Michael, a great artist who would always inspire me to work on my drawing skills. He 
				gave me drawing guide books so that I could learn techniques and develop muscle memory to draw better pictures. Ever since I received the book, I enhanced my skills and received compliments rather than complaints from future teachers on my art assignments. From this point forward, I fell in love with creating masterpieces. Below is an image that showcases my training at the age of 9. I was learning how to draw a cartoon dog.

				<dd>At the beginning of 6th grade in middle school, I discovered that I would be able to take elective classes that interested me. The introduction to art classes would always catch my eye and draw me in. I preformed well in 6th grade so I was inspired to take more art classes for the rest of my middle school years.</dd>
				<dd>New art topics I learned:
					<ul class="tablet-desktop">
						<li>Color theory</li>
						<li>Shading</li>
						<li>Linework</li>
						<li>Drawing from observations</li>
						<li>Proportions</li>
					</ul>

			<dt>High School</dt>
				<dd>More art class opportunities arised during my high school education. I had to retake an introductory art class in order to unlock the advanced classes. My high school provided both digital and traditional art classes which I participated in after completing basic introductory requirements.
				In my digital graphic design class, I learned how to use Adobe software to create logos, edit pictures, and draw digitally.
				I also took a photography class in my senior year where I learned how to manually set up a camera for specific shots. I eventually learned how I could incorporate drawing and photographing into one with light painting.
				In my Advanced Studio Art class based on traditional mediums, I discovered how to put my own emotion and personality into my artwork. Below is a piece I created in Advanced Studio Art. You will see more of my high school art and photography on my <a href="gallery.html">Art Gallery page.</a></dd>
