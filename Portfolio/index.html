			<p><span class="action">Greetings!</span> My name is Amara Cramer and I am an artist looking to share my art portfolio with potential clients and employers in need
			of a design to share their business, idea, or product with professional creativity.</p>
	
			<p><span class="action">So what is an artist?</span> An artist is a person who creates representative work using a chosen medium. Artists can either
			represent their own ideas or someone elses when producing artwork. The end goal for artists is to make something that
			is eye-catching and rememberable. "A true artist is not one who is inspired, but one who inspires others." ~Salvador Dali
			</p>
		
			<p>Creating art has sparked my interest since I was in elementary school. I continued to develop my skills all the way to high school graduation and desire to incorporate art into my future career. 
			I currently have skilled experience in both digital and traditional art as well as photography. For more details on my current work, skills, and experience, feel free to navigate my website using the tabs at the top of this page.</p>
